# My C Journey

Welcome to **My C Journey**! This repository is a collection of my learning process, projects, and experiments with the C programming language. Whether you're a beginner looking for reference code or an experienced developer interested in seeing different approaches, I hope you find this repository useful.

## About This Repository
This repository serves as a log of my progress in learning C, covering fundamental concepts, data structures, algorithms, and small projects.

### Topics Covered
- Basics of C (syntax, variables, data types, control flow)
- Functions and modular programming
- Pointers and memory management
- File handling in C
- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.)
- System programming concepts
- Mini projects
